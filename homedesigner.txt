- elevations & elevation surface contour tracing editor
	- surface parametrization:
		- path
		- indoor/outdoor flag
	- keep surface contours aligned while editing
	- auto-generate missing surfaces from surface diff'ing the overlapping elevations
		- suspended underfloors
		- terraces
		- roofs
	- auto-generate exterior walls
	- auto-generate

- roof editor
	roof parametrization:
		- overhang offsets
	- roof ridge lines and ridge heights
		- auto generate hip lines
		- auto-snap-to gabled/shed/flat
	- parametrization:
		- truss
		- with/without soffits

-> generate exterior surfaces for differences
-> generate exterior walls around the union of all interior surfaces
